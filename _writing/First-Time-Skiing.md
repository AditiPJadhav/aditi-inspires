 I climbed the snowy hill with my boards in my hands. My legs quivered, shivered, and trembled. My heart was beating at top speed, it was like it was popping out of my chest. I was shaking in trepidation, abating on what would happen when I got on my skis, would I fall, slip, or even worse, break a bone.  

“You got this Aditi!” My friend Aubrey announced, who had blonde silky hair, tied up into a high-raised ponytail. She had blue, calming catty eyes like the petals of the Evolvulus Blue Daze sinking gently down to the bottom of Brazil’s soft ground. 

15 hours prior I had been exceedingly exuberant on going skiing, as my dad drove me to the campsite near the Pocono mountains. I was going to be camping that night then in the morning I would go to the ski area.

It was a chilly day, slightly overcasted, but every minute the sun kept trying harder and harder to escape the cloudy cage, trying to shine brighter. The air smelt like the crisp sweet smell of coldness and a hint of cinnamon.

Today was the day I was going to ski for the first time in my life. Just as I was filled with exhilaration, most of my sensation turned into nervousness. I felt like there was someone twisting a huge knot in my stomach, trying to unravel it, but instead making the knot stronger.

As I got on the bus with my Girl Scout troop, I was shivering cold even in a jacket and snowsuit. I sat with my friend Dia, and across from Aubrey and Ava. Dia had obsidian colored hair, as dark as a black jaguar lurking in the shadows. She also had a persian blue jacket with red ladybugs dotted all over it and boots the color of a ringed seal. On the way there I saw the bare trees as quiet as they could be; and warm, cozy cottage-looking homes. After about a few minutes I questioned Dia, “Have you ever skied before?” She turned around and excitedly answered, “I haven’t, but I can’t wait to actually get to it.” 

“Same, but I am a bit nervous too,” I was actually immensely nervous, not just that, but extremely nervous.

Then we both looked back out the window because the views were very picturesque, then finally we saw a little ski shop in sight. We all got off the bus, the sun was glimmering more scintillating by the second and I was overflowing with warmth. 

We walked for about 2 minutes, then reached the ski shop which had ancient, glass panes for windows almost as clear and transparent as the Weddell Sea. The shop was made of teak wood, and it had an emerald green roof. As the ground transformed from gravel to wood, the white light accented the color of the shop. The shop smelled like the calm cozy feeling after tasting the delectableness of ice cream.

Right when we got in we were greeted by a middle-aged woman who asked kindly to our troop leader Mrs. Carla, “Hello, my name is Lou, how may I help you?” Mrs Carla was Aubrey's mom, she had shoulder length hair and a blue snowsuit with candy apple red coruscating sparkles. 

I waited for 6 min till it was my turn, then she turned around to assist me, “Ok honey, what’s your name and shoe size?” asked Lou, who was quite rushed.

“My name is Aditi and my shoe size is 3.” I answered.

“Alright, now take this ticket to the 2nd counter.” she told me, then gestured her hand toward a long line filled with about 10 people.

When I got to the line, I saw my friend Ava waiting in another line which had around 15 people. Then I motioned Ava to come to my line; she was wearing a cloudy pink snowsuit and a pretty purple fluffy jacket with flowers the color of the golden gate of Versailles. She started telling me about how fun her first time skiing was, and how I didn’t need to worry cause it was so very enjoyable.

Finally it was my turn and a young man at the counter signaled his hand as he asked “Can I have your ticket?” He had warm eyes and a sweater vest on which was velvet red and French blue.

“Here you go.” I uttered, placing the ticket in the man’s open hand.

“Ok,” he said in a jolly-jumping way, “size 3 coming right up!”

He asked, shouting over the crowd, to a woman about his age to go get size 3. She was wearing a flimsy pink and silver jacket that flew behind her as she went to the back of aisle 2 carefully on her royal purple roller skates. Then as she brought the shoes, her curly, brown, frazzled hair slipped onto her face. She suddenly came to a stop and as she did she flipped her head so that her busy hair would soar off her face.
“Thanks!” I called, grabbing the skis cautiously out of her cold hands.

“You’re welcome,” she said humbly as she started assisting another customer.

As I started to head towards the bench so I could try on the skis, my heart leaped out of my chest as I started gliding on the wet floor, and my right foot slid backward. I looked like an ice skater skating in an arabesque. I tried to stay balanced as I landed unsecurely, skis still in my hand. As I neared the bench Aubrey and Dia, who were about to try on their skis, grasped my arms tightly and ceased me to a stop; my heart slowly arrived back into my chest, like a bird fluttering to its nest.

Aubrey anxiously asked, “Are you okay?” I heard the tremble in her voice. I also saw a startled expression planted on Dia’s face.

“I’m okay, I think.” I said startled and ruffled, then shaking my head to ring me back into the moment.

After the frightening moment, I tried on the skis which fit perfectly, even though I needed help from one of the leaders. Then I put my normal boots which were black, gray and fluffy at the top, on a sectioned wall filled with shoe-sized boxes.

When everybody finished trying on their ski shoes, all of us carefully walked into the snack room. We all sat down on 3 benches. As the troop leaders grabbed a few energy bars out of their bags. The auroma sailed through the air elegantly landing in the whiffs of my breath.

“Here you go girls, in around 30 minutes we’ll start skiing so we need to get enough energy.” Mrs.Carla said handing out energy bars.

I started getting more anxious about skiing now that she had brought it up. I got to my bar and started unwrapping as I heard people talking, food in their mouth, about how fun skiing is or how they couldn’t wait, I also heard people talking about how nervous they were. I took a bite out of the bar, the crunch came out as crisp as a hail crashing onto shutters.

As we all finished our snack, we started walking extra carefully, trying, although once in a while a few people slipped and tripped, outside to another little shop which sort of looked like an ice cream shop. After 2 minutes of striding through the crowd, we lined up in a line with 2 people. I was 3rd in line so I didn’t have to wait long until it was my turn. 

When it was my turn the plump red haired man asked me, “What is your height?” in sort of a stultified way.

“I am 4 feet 6 inches.” I noted, as I tried to bump up the enthusiasm.

“Drake, we’ve got 4 feet and 6 inch.” the red haired man said.

Another guy, supposedly Drake, brought a pair of skis in his hands. They looked ¾ the size of me, as Drake handed the skis to me ignorantly, like he did to everybody else, I started falling back because of the force he passed on. Then I slowly started to balance.

After everybody had gotten their skis we started walking toward the ski hill. On the way there we saw a sign which had printed on it in chalk Fake Snow on Ski Hill. My head flicked up then I saw the hill rising overhead. My thoughts were rushing through my head, as my skis started to get heavier. As we stepped onto the gracious, soft, crunching snow and I started shivering more than ever, my consciousness started crawling up my spine, like a spider inching up its web.

We were walking to an advanced beginner section of the hill as Mrs.Carla was saying, “Girls make sure you listen to the instructor nicely so you don’t get injured or anything else, but also have fun while doing it. Also our instructor's name is Mr.Pinder.” she explained reassuringly. We finally saw a tall pleasant-looking young woman waving affectionately at us near the sign as she walked with her purple skis in her hands. She had her sleek, satiny, and chestnut-colored hair fastened into a bun, she also had a flowery scarf wrapped around her neck.

As we neared the flag designated for the advanced beginners, the instructor was fast walking, catching up to us like it was nothing.

“Hello, how is everyone doing? I am Anna and I will be your substitute instructor for today.” she called out loudly through the crowd.

“Ok now we will begin to learn how to just glide through the snow,” she noted as she finally reached a spot where everyone could see her.

“First we will go over names for me, then we will start learning how to get on skis, next we will learn how to move, and lastly we will learn how to turn.” she quickly spoke, soft, but clear.

She described “We will start with Mrs.Carla, and then go down the line. I also want to make it clear that I have a class right after this, it's cut-to-cut.”

“Alright, as everyone knows I am Mrs.Carla.” 

When we finally got to the end of the line, and everyone was finished she told us, “Great, now let's learn how to stand on our skis, so first we have to lock the notches on the skis to your shoes.”

As everyone went down onto the snow to secure their skis to their shoes, then attempted to stand up, while those who were experienced did it as if it were a piece of cake; some needed help fastening their skis.

After everyone had finished Anna said, “Now we will learn how to move, we are going to be on that slope, so the downhill will make a slide. To solve this problem we have to learn how to stop, which will help us when we want to halt. Basically we have to keep our skis like this,” she pointed at her feet where the tips of the skis were set together in an arrow, “make sure you don’t let the skis get on top of each other, otherwise you will collapse.”

“Ok,” everyone said as we tried it out, all of a sudden I started to wobble then fall belly flat on the snow, then I realized that my skis ahd overlapped. A few other girls had fallen too, mostly because even though it looked easy the way Anna did it, it was a little exhausting.

“Great work, also Grace and Emma, as well as a few others, I need for you to make skis a little closer together,” grunting, a few people had their feet twisted in, I was in the middle of being really far apart to perfectly close; the leaders and Anna went around to make sure everyone was doing it correctly, “good job, now you need to know that when you need to start you are in this stop position, then you will make you skis straight. Yes, like that Dia! Ok, now when you come to me you go into your stop position. Alright now let’s start to go to that little slope.”

We all followed Anna, walking leisurely in our skis. When we reached the top, we began forming a line, Ava and Aubrey went at the start because they knew how to ski, then Dia followed 3rd. I tried to go last, but Grace and Emma were more scared than me so I let them go behind me. 

I saw Anna go down to the end of the slope, then shout, “Ready Ava! 3, 2, 1. Go!”

Ava slid down the hill gracefully, slowed to a stop, “Amazing job Ava. Alright now climb up the hill, slowly. Good, now Aubrey it's your turn.”

When it was finally my turn I started shaking like I was wearing shorts and a tank top in Antarctica; and I was exceeding then I trembled, “I-I’m scared th-that I m-might fall o-or s-something.” my voice was going as loudly as it can, which was a gentle whisper.

“It’s okay, you don’t need to worry, I promise it's going to be super fun.” Dia mentioned

“Yeah,” Aubrey added, as Ava nodded approvingly.

I took a deep breath in, then remembered the time when I first tried zip lining. I was almost as afraid as I was then, but I knew if I never tried it, I would never know how fun it would be. So I got out of the stop position, and I slid sophisticatedly,thoughts zooming through my mind as fast as light, tension filling me like water being poured carefully into a glass. Then at the end of the hill I transitioned into the stop position. It felt stunning, I was amazed,  I had done it, I told myself! Proudly I staggered up the hill, still believing I hadn’t done it.

When I got to the top Ava mentioned, “You did marvelous, did you like it?”

“Extremely fun,” I squealed cheerfully, “I think skiing is now my favorite thing ever, I just can’t believe I did it. I am so proud of myself. Couldn’t have done it without your help and encouragement.”

After going at least 20 more times, Anna announced, “Ok, turning time. To turn in one direction, for example to the right, you would have to lean the opposite direction, to the left.”

We all tried doing the position that Anna showed us leaning to the left and right. Around 4 had decided then that they wanted to go back into the snack room, they were all complaining about how they wanted to go inside and how tired they were.

When it was my turn I got out of stop position I slid, then leaned to my left then right. As I leaned to my right, I pulled myself down too much and fell.

“You good,” Anna questioned me, reaching out her hand to pull me up.

“Yep, leaned too much I think” I answered, grabbing the offered hand and rising from the ground.

This wasn’t going to stop me, I tried 3 more times and succeeded and didn't fall for the next 15 times.

Aubrey and Ava wanted to go to the big hill, so Mrs. Carla told them that they would be able to go in 2 min when she was ready. I felt ready for skiing from at least ¾ of the hill.

“Dia do you want to go to the top?” I asked optimistically.

“Yeah, for sure!” she answered hyper excitedly.

I asked hoping she would say yes, the closest leader around Ava mom, Mrs. Lin who looked almost exactly like Ava, “Mrs. Lin, can Dia and I go ¾ of the way up the hill?”

“Sure honey,” she said generously.

I was thrilled, I couldn’t wait; it was going to be stupendous. I knew Dia was as thrilled as me.

That day I had learned that if you never try something and be afraid you’ll never be able to experience the suspense before, the proudness after, and especially the most fun you can ever have.
